## Answer

Topic: If the mountain doesn't come through, I'll go through: A positive attitude towards life in response to challenges

In our life, we always encounter various difficulties and challenges. In the face of these difficulties, some people choose to escape, some choose to complain, while some choose to bravely meet the challenge. The Analects of Confucius - Yangguo once said, "If the mountain does not come over, I will go over." This ancient wisdom teaches us that when we encounter difficulties, we should be brave enough to change what can be changed and adapt to what cannot be changed. This positive attitude toward life allows us to grow and become a better version of ourselves in the face of adversity.

First, we must learn to be brave enough to change what can be changed. There are difficulties and challenges in life that we can change. In the face of these difficulties, we should be brave enough to try, to change, to broaden our circle of life. Do not confine yourself to your comfort zone, but be brave enough to try new things and challenge yourself. Only in this way can we continue to grow and have a richer life experience.

For example, in the workplace, we may encounter fierce competition and great pressure. In this case, we should not choose to escape or complain, but should try to improve our ability, learn to adjust our mindset and actively deal with the challenges. Only in this way can we succeed in the workplace and realize our life value.

Second, we should learn to adapt to everything that cannot be changed. In life, there are some difficulties and challenges that we cannot change. In the face of such difficulties, we should not be pessimistic and disappointed, but should learn to adapt and adjust their mindset. Only in this way can we maintain a positive mindset in the face of adversity and thus get through it.

For example, in interpersonal relationships, we may encounter people who are not easy to get along with. For this situation, we should learn to adjust our mindset and try to maintain a harmonious relationship with these people. We cannot expect to change others, but we can resolve conflicts by changing our own attitudes and adapting to such difficulties.

Finally, we should learn to grow in the face of adversity. Adversity is part of life, and it is in adversity that we learn to persevere and to be brave. In the face of difficulties, we should be brave enough to meet the challenges, constantly exercise ourselves and improve our abilities. Only in this way can we grow in adversity and realize our value.

A typical example is Steve Jobs. In his career, he once encountered the plight of being fired from the Apple company he founded. But he did not give up, but chose to adapt to this setback and regain his strength. He created Pixar Animation and NeXT, and eventually returned to Apple to lead it to a new level of glory. This fully proves that the importance of growing up in adversity.

At the same time, we should also learn to cherish the valuable experience that adversity brings us. It is adversity that makes us stronger and more courageous. The setbacks and pains in adversity can become the most solid ladder on our way forward. They allow us to learn how to face difficulties, how to adapt to the various aspects of life is not as good. These experiences are the most valuable assets in our life, they make us a more mature and stronger person.

In short, the concept of "the mountain does not come over, I go over" is a positive attitude towards life, which teaches us to be brave in the face of difficulties to change everything that can be changed and adapt to everything that cannot be changed. This attitude allows us to grow in the face of adversity and have a richer life. Therefore, we should cherish adversity, be brave to meet the challenges, and strive to achieve our dreams. Only in this way can we firmly walk our own path in a world full of variables.

题目：山不过来，我过去：积极应对挑战的生活态度

在我们的生活中，总会遇到各种各样的困难和挑战。面对这些困难，有的人选择逃避，有的人选择抱怨，而有的人选择勇敢地迎接挑战。《论语·阳货》曾说：“山不过来，我过去。”这句古老的智慧教导我们，在遇到困难时，要勇敢地去改变可以改变的，去适应不能改变的。这种积极的生活态度，让我们在逆境中成长，成为更好的自己。

首先，我们要学会勇敢地改变可以改变的一切。生活中的困难和挑战，有的是我们可以改变的。面对这些困难，我们应该勇敢地去尝试，去改变，去拓宽自己的生活圈。不要把自己局限在舒适区内，要勇敢地去尝试新事物，去挑战自己。只有这样，我们才能不断地成长，拥有更丰富的人生经历。

例如，在职场中，我们可能会遇到竞争激烈、压力巨大的情况。在这种情况下，我们不应该选择逃避或抱怨，而应该努力提高自己的能力，学会调整心态，积极应对挑战。只有这样，我们才能在职场中取得成功，实现自己的人生价值。

其次，我们要学会适应不能改变的一切。在生活中，有些困难和挑战是我们无法改变的。面对这样的困难，我们不应该悲观失望，而应该学会适应，调整自己的心态。只有这样，我们才能在逆境中保持积极的心态，从而度过难关。

比如，在人际关系中，我们可能会遇到不易相处的人。对于这种情况，我们应该学会调整自己的心态，尽量与这些人保持和谐的关系。我们不能期望改变他人，但我们可以通过改变自己的态度，适应这种困难，从而化解矛盾。

最后，我们要学会在逆境中成长。逆境是人生的一部分，正是在逆境中，我们学会了坚持，学会了勇敢。面对困难，我们要勇敢地去迎接挑战，不断地锻炼自己，提高自己的能力。只有这样，我们才能在逆境中成长，实现自己的价值。

一个典型的例子是乔布斯。在他的职业生涯中，曾经遭遇过被自己创办的苹果公司解雇的困境。但他并没有放弃，而是选择了适应这个挫折，重新振作起来。他创建了皮克斯动画公司和NeXT公司，最终重返苹果公司，带领苹果走向了一个新的辉煌。这充分证明了，在逆境中成长的重要性。

同时，我们也要学会珍惜逆境带给我们的宝贵经验。正是逆境，让我们变得更加坚强，更加勇敢。逆境中的挫折与痛苦，可以成为我们前进道路上最坚实的阶梯。它们让我们学会了如何去面对困难，如何去适应生活的种种不如意。这些经验是我们人生中最宝贵的财富，它们使我们成为一个更加成熟、更加坚强的人。

总之，“山不过来，我过去”这一观念是一种积极的生活态度，它教会我们在困难面前要勇敢地去改变可以改变的一切，适应不能改变的一切。这种态度，让我们在逆境中不断成长，拥有更丰富的人生。因此，我们应该珍惜逆境，勇敢地去迎接挑战，努力去实现自己的梦想。只有这样，我们才能在这个充满变数的世界中，坚定地走好属于自己的路。

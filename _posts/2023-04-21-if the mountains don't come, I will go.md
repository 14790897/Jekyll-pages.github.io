Topic: If the mountain doesn't come through, I'll go through: A positive attitude towards life in response to challenges

In our life, we always encounter various difficulties and challenges. In the face of these difficulties, some people choose to escape, some choose to complain, while some choose to bravely meet the challenge. The Analects of Confucius - Yangguo once said, "If the mountain does not come over, I will go over." This ancient wisdom teaches us that when we encounter difficulties, we should be brave enough to change what can be changed and adapt to what cannot be changed. This positive attitude toward life allows us to grow and become a better version of ourselves in the face of adversity.

First, we must learn to be brave enough to change what can be changed. There are difficulties and challenges in life that we can change.

For this situation, we should learn to adjust our mindset and try to maintain a harmonious relationship with these people. We cannot expect to change others, but we can resolve conflicts by changing our own attitudes and adapting to such difficulties.

In the face of difficulties, we should be brave enough to meet the challenges, constantly exercise ourselves and improve our abilities. Only in this way can we grow in adversity and realize our value.

A typical example is Steve Jobs. In his career, he once encountered the plight of being fired from the Apple company he founded. But he did not give up, but chose to adapt to this setback and regain his strength. He created Pixar Animation and NeXT, and eventually returned to Apple to lead it to a new level of glory. This fully proves that the importance of growing up in adversity.

At the same time, we should also learn to cherish the valuable experience that adversity brings us. It is adversity that makes us stronger and more courageous. The setbacks and pains in adversity can become the most solid ladder on our way forward. They allow us to learn how to face difficulties, how to adapt to the various aspects of life is not as good. These experiences are the most valuable assets in our life, they make us a more mature and stronger person.

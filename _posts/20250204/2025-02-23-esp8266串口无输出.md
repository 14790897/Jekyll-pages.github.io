## 问题

platformio 上传代码到 ESP8266 之后，串口无输出，提示如下：

```
--- forcing DTR inactive
--- forcing RTS inactive
--- Terminal on COM4 | 115200 8-N-1
--- Available filters and text transformations: colorize, debug, default, direct, esp8266_exception_decoder, hexlify, log2file, nocontrol, printable, send_on_enter, time
--- More details at https://bit.ly/pio-monitor-filters
--- Quit: Ctrl+C | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H
```

## 解决方法

Well a few ESP32 boards have a mechanism that connects RTS/DTR to the EN/GPIO0 lines – if these are driven the wrong way when the serial monitor opens, it might shut down the ESP32.

Can you try adding each of those blocks to the platformio.ini and retry opening the serial monitor (just “Monitor” task)? If one doesn’t make a difference, delete it again and try the next one.
1.)

monitor_rts = 0
monitor_dtr = 0
2.)

monitor_rts = 0
monitor_dtr = 1
3.)

monitor_rts = 1
monitor_dtr = 0
4.)

monitor_rts = 1
monitor_dtr = 1
(docs for that command)

在我的情况下

```
monitor_rts = 0
monitor_dtr = 1
```

解决了问题。

此外还需要安装驱动, 我安装的是 [CH341SER.EXE](https://arduino.nxez.com/arduino-uno-r3-drivers)

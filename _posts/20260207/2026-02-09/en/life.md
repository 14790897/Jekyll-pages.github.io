title: '[Anti-Inspirational] Don''t Be Moved by the ''4,094 Ancestors'': Do You Know
  How Many People It Takes to Ensure Your Non-Existence?'
---

I recently saw a video, sentimentally proclaiming: “For you to come into this world, 4,094 ancestors stand behind you.” It was accompanied by emotional music, telling you what a miracle life is, how much of a chosen one you are, as if you bear the KPI of these 4,000+ people and must live a life that moves heaven and earth.

Many people cried watching it, but looking at those numbers, I felt this bowl of chicken soup was not only logically flawed but also too narrow in scope.

If "existence" is a relay race involving 4,094 people, have you ever considered the scale required for "non-existence"?

Today, I will use **“reverse logic”** to settle the score: **If you didn't exist, that would be a grand project that startled all of humanity.**

#### I. Your "Existence" Required the Success of 4,094 People; Your "Non-Existence" Required the "Conspiracy" of Hundreds of Millions

The inspirational text tells you that for you to be born, your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents... a total of 4,094 people (tracing back about 11-12 generations) had to meet, fall in love, and reproduce precisely.

Sounds like a lot of effort, right? But let's look at it differently:

**Assume the current you “does not exist.”**

What does this mean? It means that at every specific historical moment, the **hundreds of millions of people** then existing on Earth all failed to give birth to you.

This is like buying a lottery ticket. The winning number (you) only requires a few balls to land in the right spot. **However, to ensure you “don't win,” the hundreds of millions of remaining balls in the lottery pool must all “perfectly avoid” that winning position.**

Imagine if your “non-existence” were a predetermined outcome. The achievement of this outcome required the collective effort of hundreds of millions of people then on Earth:

*   Zhang San didn't meet Li Si;
*   Wang Wu met Zhao Liu, but they weren't in the mood that day;
*   Your 10th-generation ancestor might have fallen for Cui Hua from the next village, instead of your direct great-great-grandmother;
*   Or even a butterfly effect across the ocean caused a great migration, completely scrambling the genetic permutations.

To ensure that **you were absent** from the universe, **all humans** then on Earth (except for those specific pairs of ancestors who combined) were “working hard” in various ways. They used their original life trajectories to construct an airtight net, blocking you from the door of existence.

**Compared to the “smooth sailing” of 4,094 people, the “strict defense” of those hundreds of millions is the true astronomical figure.**


#### II. The Universe's Default State Is "Without You"

We are always accustomed to celebrating “presence” but ignore the massive energy required to maintain “absence.”

The Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us that the universe tends toward disorder (entropy increase). **Life, this highly ordered “negative entropy” entity, is essentially a bug in the universe.**

If you didn't exist in that parallel timeline, it means the universe was operating smoothly according to its physical laws. Hundreds of millions of people ate, slept, and went about their business; millions of years passed with great changes—everyone was busy maintaining the normal operation of this world—and the result of this normal operation was **no need for your appearance.**

So, stop being self-congratulatory about those 4,094 ancestors.

Those 4,094 people merely happened to let you slip through a crack in probability. If that crack had shifted even slightly, if any one of the hundreds of millions of remaining people worldwide had interfered with that lineage, you would “not exist.”

**The conclusion is brutal:**

If “giving birth to you” was a small team-building exercise for 4,094 people;
Then “not giving birth to you” was a massive chorus sung by hundreds of millions of humans.

**What we call “my non-existence” is the most tacit, grandest, and most effortlessly achieved collective conspiracy of all humanity.**

Therefore, don't think the 4,094 people behind you carry much weight. Compared to the billions of beings who silently served as the backdrop to ensure your “non-existence,” that weight is truly insignificant.

Live well while you are alive, and stop making such a big deal out of yourself.

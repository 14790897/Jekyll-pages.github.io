Title: Science, Technology and Art: Reflections and Search for Harmony in the Age of Scientific Utilitarianism

Today, we live in an era of rapidly changing science and technology, and the constant expansion of science has led to great achievements in various fields. However, this era is also accompanied by the atrophy of art, and the separation and antagonism between the spirit of science and art are becoming more and more obvious. In such a context, we need to reflect on how to get rid of the shackles of utilitarianism and realize the harmonious coexistence of science and art at a time of rapid development of science and technology.

First of all, scientific utilitarianism has to a certain extent led to the separation and opposition between the spirit of science and art. This concept emphasizes the practicality and benefits of scientific and technological development, causing people to focus on the relationship between means and utilitarian ends, while ignoring whether the ends themselves are reasonable. Under such circumstances, people tend to fall into the worship of "instrumental rationality" and neglect the aesthetic feeling and value guidance that art brings to us.

Further, when we lose respect for individual subjective emotional experience, people are easily objectified and see efficiency as the only goal of life. In this atrophied artistic environment, we lose the spiritual support and the guarantee of sound personality that art provides for us. Therefore, we need to re-examine the relationship between science and art and seek a harmonious symbiosis between the two.

To achieve a harmonious symbiosis between science and art, we must first start with education. We should strengthen art education in our education system and cultivate students' interest and sensitivity to art, so that they can experience the beauty of art while learning science and technology. Through a comprehensive education of science and art, we can cultivate composite talents with both scientific literacy and artistic emotions.

Second, we need to create a social environment that is conducive to the joint development of science and art. The government and the community should pay attention to and support the development of art, consider the combination of science and art as an innovation, provide a platform and resources for artists and scientists, and encourage them to collaborate across borders in their respective fields. For example, the Starlight Path in the Netherlands is an example of a perfect combination of technology and art, an innovative design that not only brings practicality and environmental protection to the bicycle path, but also gives it a unique artistic value.

In addition, we should strengthen the dialogue and exchange between science and art. In academic research, enterprise development, and social activities, we should encourage people to look at problems from diverse perspectives, examine scientific achievements with artistic eyes, and promote artistic innovation with scientific methods. Through this cross-border interaction, we can promote mutual understanding and respect between science and art, and thus get rid of the mindset of purely pursuing utilitarianism.

Finally, we also need to self-reflect and adjust at the individual level. Contemporary people should realize that the values of science and art are not completely opposed to each other, but can complement each other. In the process of scientific and technological development, we should not neglect the important role of art in nourishing the individual's soul and sound personality. Therefore, while pursuing the development of science and technology, we should pay attention to the value of art, so that science and technology and art can jointly bring beauty and richness to our life.

In short, in the present time of rapid development of science and technology, we should not let scientific utilitarianism dominate our values, but should strive to achieve a harmonious symbiosis between science and art. By strengthening education, creating a favorable environment, promoting communication and cooperation, and engaging in personal reflection, we can make science and art mutually reinforcing and contribute together to the development and progress of humanity. This will help us to escape from materialization, regain respect for individual subjective emotional experiences, and achieve a better and richer life.

Title: The Value of Being Needed and Self-Realization

In modern society, people are not only concerned about their own needs, but also desire to be needed by others. This "needed" mentality is prevalent in all aspects of life, from work and family to interpersonal relationships. In this article, we will explore the roots of this "needy" mentality, its meaning, and how to deal with it properly.

First, we need to recognize that this "needy" mentality is not entirely negative. From a biological point of view, this mentality may be an inherent part of human genes. In ancient times, competition for survival was fierce, and people needed to work together to fight foreign enemies and natural disasters. In this environment, individuals who were able to provide help and support to others were more likely to gain the trust and reliance of others, thus increasing their chances of survival. Therefore, this "needy" mentality can be seen as a product of human evolution to a certain extent.

From a psychological point of view, people's desire to be needed is also related to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory. According to this theory, human needs can be divided into five levels, from low to high: physiological needs, security needs, social needs, respect needs and self-actualization needs. After satisfying the basic physiological and safety needs, people naturally focus on social and respect needs, and being needed by others is one of the ways to achieve these two needs.

However, this "needy" mentality can also lead to problems. Excessive attention to being needed by others may lead individuals to a state of mind that is overly dependent on the approval and affirmation of others, which can lead to impaired self-esteem and a decreased sense of self-worth. In addition, too much desire to be needed may also make people behave too pandering and flattering in interpersonal relationships, losing their true selves.

So, how to properly deal with this "needy" mentality?

First, we need to face our own needs. Everyone has his or her own needs, which is normal. Acknowledging our needs and trying to meet them is a prerequisite for achieving self-worth and happiness. In this process, we have to learn to balance our own needs and the needs of others, not to overly pursue being needed by others, and not to completely ignore the dependence of others on us.

Second, we need to establish correct self-values. One's value does not only lie in being needed by others, but also in one's own abilities, qualities, talents and contributions to society. We need to realize that our value does not depend only on the evaluation of others, but is embedded in our own growth and progress. Therefore, we need to establish independent self-values and not overly pursue the approval of others, but focus on self-improvement and achieving our goals.

Furthermore, we need to learn to build healthy interpersonal relationships. When dealing with others, we should respect the needs of others, but also adhere to our own principles and bottom line. Being needed by others can cause us to lose ourselves in relationships, so we need to learn to find a balance between caring for others and maintaining our independence. Only in this way can we be true to ourselves in interpersonal relationships and build deep friendships and trust.

Finally, we need to pay attention to our own mental health. Excessive desire to be needed by others may lead to psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression. We need to pay attention to our emotions, adjust our mindset in time and learn to relieve stress. In addition, we can also seek professional psychological help in order to better cope with the challenges and problems in life.

In short, the "needed" mentality is common in people's lives, and it has both positive and problematic aspects. We should face up to this mentality, learn to balance our own needs and the needs of others, establish correct self-values, and pay attention to mental health in order to achieve self-worth and happiness. In the process, we can not only provide help and support to others, but also achieve our own growth and development and make life better.

题目：被需要的价值与自我实现

在现代社会中，人们不仅关注自身的需求，还渴望被他人需要。这种“被需要”的心态普遍存在于生活的方方面面，从工作、家庭到人际关系等。在这篇文章中，我们将探讨这种“被需要”的心态的根源、意义以及如何正确对待它。

首先，我们要认识到，这种“被需要”的心态并非完全消极。从生物学的角度来看，这种心态可能是人类基因中固有的一部分。在远古时代，生存竞争激烈，人们需要团结协作才能共同对抗外敌和自然灾害。在这种环境下，能够为他人提供帮助和支持的个体更容易获得他人的信任和依赖，从而提高生存几率。因此，这种“被需要”的心态在一定程度上可以看作是人类进化的产物。

从心理学的角度来看，人们渴望被需要也与马斯洛需求层次理论有关。根据这一理论，人类的需求可以分为五个层次，从低到高依次为生理需求、安全需求、社交需求、尊重需求和自我实现需求。在满足了基本的生理和安全需求之后，人们很自然地会关注社交和尊重需求，而被他人需要正是实现这两个需求的途径之一。

然而，这种“被需要”的心态也可能导致一些问题。过分关注被他人需要可能会让个体陷入一种过分依赖他人认可和肯定的心理状态，从而导致自尊心受损和自我价值感下降。另外，过于渴望被需要也可能让人在人际关系中表现得过于迎合和逢迎，失去了真实的自我。

那么，如何正确对待这种“被需要”的心态呢？

首先，我们要正视自己的需求。每个人都有自己的需求，这是正常的。承认自己的需求，并努力满足它们，是实现自我价值和幸福的前提。在这个过程中，我们要学会平衡自身的需求和他人的需求，不要过分追求被他人需要，也不要完全忽视他人对我们的依赖。

其次，我们要建立正确的自我价值观。一个人的价值并不仅仅在于被他人需要，还包括自身的能力、品质、才华以及为社会做出的贡献等。我们要认识到，自己的价值并非仅仅取决于他人的评价，而是内在于自己的成长和进步。因此，我们要树立独立的自我价值观，不过分追求他人的认可，而是专注于自我提升和实现自己的目标。

再者，我们要学会建立健康的人际关系。在与他人相处时，我们应当尊重他人的需求，同时也要坚守自己的原则和底线。过分追求被他人需要可能让我们在人际关系中失去自我，因此我们要学会在关心他人和保持自己独立性之间找到平衡点。只有这样，我们才能在人际交往中真实地展现自己，建立起深厚的友谊和信任。

最后，我们要关注自己的心理健康。过分渴望被他人需要可能导致心理问题，如焦虑、抑郁等。我们要关注自己的情绪，及时调整心态，学会排解压力。此外，我们还可以寻求专业的心理帮助，以便更好地应对生活中的挑战和困扰。

总之，“被需要”的心态在人们的生活中普遍存在，它既有积极的一面，也可能带来一些问题。我们要正视这种心态，学会平衡自己的需求和他人的需求，建立正确的自我价值观，关注心理健康，从而实现自我价值和幸福。在这个过程中，我们不仅能够为他人提供帮助和支持，还能够实现自己的成长和发展，让生活更加美好。

title: AI-Generated Content Always Comes with Extra Spaces? Fix It Perfectly with
  Word Wildcards in One Click
---

In the era of AI-assisted writing, we often copy content generated by ChatGPT, Claude, or DeepSeek into Word documents.

But have you noticed a frustrating detail?

**AI-generated Chinese content often forcibly adds a space between "Chinese characters" and "English/numbers".**

In Word, the software itself automatically adjusts the visual spacing between Chinese and Western text. If there's already a space, combined with Word's automatic adjustment, the gap becomes excessively large, looking sparse and unprofessional.

**Don't delete the spaces manually one by one!** Today, I'm sharing a Word "Wildcard" replacement trick that solves formatting issues for dozens of pages in just 3 seconds.

## Core Principle: Word Wildcards

We need to use Word's advanced Find and Replace feature to precisely locate those **spaces sandwiched between Chinese and English** using "regular expressions" and delete them.

### Preparation

1. Open your Word document and press **`Ctrl + H`** to open "Find and Replace".
2. Click the **"More >>"** button in the bottom left corner.
3. **Key Step: You must check "Use wildcards"** (if not checked, the code below won't work).

## Scenario 1: Delete "Chinese + Space + English/Number"

This is the most common case, such as changing `测试 Test` to `测试Test`.

* **Find what:**

```text
([一-﨩])( )([a-zA-Z0-9])

```

* **Replace with:**

```text
\1\3

```

> **Code Explanation:**
> * `([一-﨩])`: Represents any Chinese character (this is Group 1).
> * `( )`: Represents that annoying space in the middle (this is Group 2).
> * `([a-zA-Z0-9])`: Represents any English letter or number (this is Group 3).
> * `\1\3`: Means keep only Group 1 (Chinese) and Group 3 (English), discarding Group 2 (the space).

## Scenario 2: Delete "English/Number + Space + Chinese"

Sometimes the space appears after the English text, such as changing `Word 通配符` to `Word通配符`.

* **Find what:**

```text
([a-zA-Z0-9])( )([一-﨩])

```

* **Replace with:**

```text
\1\3

```

## Advanced Tip: How to Avoid "Figure 1" or "Table 2"?

After batch deleting spaces using the method above, you might encounter an awkward issue:

**"Figure 1" becomes "Figure1", and "Table 2" becomes "Table2".**

The spaces in these figure/table captions are actually necessary; deleting them makes the document non-compliant with standard formatting. What should you do? Can we make the replacement feature "smarter" to only delete spaces in the body text and skip captions?

Unfortunately, **Word's wildcard feature cannot directly recognize "Styles"**. This means you cannot write a regular expression that says "find a space, but only if it's not in the 'Caption' style."

But don't worry, there are two workarounds: one is the **"Protection Method"** (a three-step process, good for occasional use), and the other is a **"VBA Macro"** (write the code once, use it forever).

### Option 1: "Protection Method" (Three Steps, Most Reliable)

The logic is: first turn the spaces in "Captions" into an **extremely unique character** (to protect them), then perform the space deletion, and finally turn the unique character back into a space.

#### Step 1: Protect spaces in captions

1. Press `Ctrl + H` to open Find and Replace.
2. Click "More" -> "Format" -> "Style", and select your caption style (usually called **"Caption"** or **"题注"**).
3. In **Find what**, enter: `^32` (the code for a space) or just type a space.
4. In **Replace with**, enter: `##########` (or any string that definitely won't appear in your text).
5. Click **"Replace All"**.

> *Now, all spaces in captions have turned into placeholders, while spaces in the body text remain unchanged.*

#### Step 2: Use regex to delete spaces in the main text

1. **Clear** the style formatting you just set (click "No Formatting" in the Find box).
2. Check **"Use wildcards"**.
3. Perform the two replacements (for "Chinese-Space-English" and "English-Space-Chinese"):

**Case A: Chinese [Space] English/Number**
* **Find what**: `([一-﨩])( )([a-zA-Z0-9])`
* **Replace with**: `\1\3`
* Click **"Replace All"**.

**Case B: English/Number [Space] Chinese**
* **Find what**: `([a-zA-Z0-9])( )([一-﨩])`
* **Replace with**: `\1\3`
* Click **"Replace All"**.

#### Step 3: Restore the captions

1. **Uncheck** "Use wildcards".
2. In **Find what**, enter: `##########` 
3. In **Replace with**, enter: `^32` (or type a space).
4. Click **"Replace All"**.

### Option 2: VBA Macro Code (One-Click Solution, Recommended)

If you need to do this frequently, manual steps are too tedious. You can use VBA code, which can **identify paragraph styles**.

1. Press `Alt + F11` to open the VBA Editor.
2. Click `Insert` -> `Module`.
3. Paste the following code:

```vba
Sub RemoveSpaceBetweenChineseAndEnglish()
    Dim para As Paragraph
    Dim rng As Range

    ' Iterate through every paragraph in the document
    For Each para In ActiveDocument.Paragraphs
        ' Exclude paragraphs where the style name contains "Caption" or "题注"
        ' Please modify "Caption" or "题注" below based on your actual style name in Word
        If InStr(para.Style, "题注") = 0 And InStr(para.Style, "Caption") = 0 Then
            Set rng = para.Range
            With rng.Find
                .ClearFormatting
                .Replacement.ClearFormatting
                .MatchWildcards = True

                ' Case 1: Chinese Space English/Number
                .Text = "([一-﨩])( )([a-zA-Z0-9])"
                .Replacement.Text = "\1\3"
                .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll

                ' Case 2: English/Number Space Chinese
                .Text = "([a-zA-Z0-9])( )([一-﨩])"
                .Replacement.Text = "\1\3"
                .Execute Replace:=wdReplaceAll
            End With
        End If
    Next para

    MsgBox "Cleanup complete! Captions skipped."
End Sub
```

4. Press `F5` to run it.

**Note**: The `InStr(para.Style, "Caption")` part is key. If your caption style has a different name, please change the code to match your actual style name.

## Summary

With this little trick, you can confidently copy large blocks of text from AI and clean up the formatting with one click.

**Remember the steps:**

1. `Ctrl + H`
2. Check "Use wildcards"
3. Enter `([一-﨩])( )([a-zA-Z0-9])`
4. Replace with `\1\3`

Efficiency is life. I hope this tip helps you with your thesis or report!
